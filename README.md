# MyRealKana
An Android app that tests your knowledge of Hiragana and Katakana.

This app was inspired by the site RealKana and replicates its method of testing knowledge of Japanese kana. 
To use the app, select which columns you would like to be tested on. You will be asked to choose both hiragana and katakana,
but you can choose any combination of each. After choosing your columns, you will be shown a picture of each kana and can
type in each of their readings. If you get it correct, you will move on to the next kana. If not, a red X will appear and the correct 
answer will automatically be typed in for you. Some kana have more than one valid reading and you can type in any of them. When you
have finished answering all the kana, you will be shown your score and can retest on the same columns or you can choose different columns.
